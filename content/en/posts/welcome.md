Hey there! This blog keeps a running log of my work on Bloc projects, experiments, and releases.

Here is the plan:

- Capture short write-ups after every milestone.
- Share weekly recap posts with highlights, blockers, and next steps.
- Publish deep dives whenever a big lesson or technique is worth documenting.

Thanks for reading and welcome aboard.
