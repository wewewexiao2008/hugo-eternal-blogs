description: "The mission behind Bloc Publishment"
---

Bloc Publishment is my notebook for building things in public. Expect honest write-ups about wins, blockers, and the thinking that ties projects together. Each entry captures:

- context on what I am trying to achieve
- what shipped (or broke) in the latest iteration
- what I am investigating next

If you want to collaborate or ask questions, reach out through the contact page.
